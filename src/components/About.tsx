        Hi, I'm Zhichao, full stack web developer with 6+ years working experience in E-Commerce, SaaS and tourism, also
        a very lucky one who found her new favorite thing after 15 weeks training at WBS Coding School. Hence, I decided
        to turn my career around and dive into the tech world while offering help as a voluntary mentor to those who are
        on their way to their luck at WBS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about solving problems and puzzles, building connections between people and systems, testing new
        technologies and recipes. I enjoy taking challenges as well as helping others to achieve theirs.
